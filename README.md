The variables are daily counts of page loads, unique visitors, first-time visitors, and returning visitors to an academic teaching notes website. 
There are 2167 rows of data spanning the date range from September 14, 2014, to August 19, 2020. 
A visit is defined as a stream of hits on one or more pages on the site on a given day by the same user, as identified by IP address. 
Multiple individuals with a shared IP address (e.g., in a computer lab) are considered as a single user, so real users may be undercounted to some extent. 
A visit is classified as "unique" if a hit from the same IP address has not come within the last 6 hours. 
Returning visitors are identified by cookies if those are accepted. 
All others are classified as first-time visitors, so the count of unique visitors is the sum of the counts of returning and first-time visitors by definition. 
The data was collected through a traffic monitoring service known as StatCounter.

Tools: I have used Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Execl, and of course Jupter Notebook to finish this project.

Purpose:

Find out the traffic pattern from past 5 years.
develop forecasting models
